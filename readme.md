# Diggy

**Diggy** is a multi-backend JavaScript **DNS resolver** for fetching DNS records in multiple ways.  
It supports:

- DNS over HTTPS (DoH)
- The native [`dig`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dig) command
- The built-in [Node.js `dns` module](https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html)

With Diggy, you can easily retrieve a variety of DNS record types for any domain â€” including **A**, **AAAA**, **SOA**,
**CNAME**, **TXT**, **MX**, and more.

## Installation

```bash
npm install diggy
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { getDnsRecords } from 'diggy';

const allRecords = await getDnsRecords('example.com');
console.log(allRecords);

const aRecords = await getDnsRecords('example.com', 'A');
console.log(aRecords);

const aRecords = await getDnsRecords('example.com', 'TXT');
console.log(aRecords);
```

The response will be an `array` of DNS records, each containing the following properties:

- `type`: The type of DNS record (e.g., A, AAAA, SOA, CA, TXT, MX, etc.)
- `name`: The name of the DNS record (e.g., the domain name)
- `data`: The value of the DNS record mostly is a string, can be an array of strings for some specific type
- `ttl`: The time-to-live of the DNS record in seconds

## Change resolver

The default DNS resolver is [Google DNS JSON Over HTTPS](https://dns.google/resolve?name=ozana.cz&type=A). You can
specify a custom resolver URL by passing it as the third argument to the `getDnsRecords` function.

```javascript
import { getDnsRecords } from 'diggy';

const myResolver = dnsJsonOverHttps("https://custom.json.dns/resolve");

const txtRecords = await getDnsRecords('example.com', "TXT", myResolver);
```
